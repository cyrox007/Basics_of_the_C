## General instructions for starting
To run the program, you first need to get a compiler. To install, run the terminal and run the following command:
```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential
```
The following command will allow us to make sure that the compiler is installed:
```bash
$ gcc -v
```
If you have received an uncompiled version of the program and are going to compile it yourself from the source code, then you need to do the following:
1. In the terminal, go to the directory with the program;
2. Start the compilation process using the command:
```bash
$ gcc â€“o main.bin main.c
```
3. Run the program with the command:
```bash
$ ./main.bin
```
